## 🚀 Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

You mentioned you already have a private repository at `https://github.com/boydiego/trading`

If you haven't pushed the latest changes yet:

```bash
cd c:\Users\dboy\trading
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Gist auto-sync functionality"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/boydiego/trading
2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

GitHub will start deploying your site. This takes about 1-2 minutes.

### Step 3: Access Your Dashboard

Once deployed, your dashboard will be available at:

```
https://boydiego.github.io/trading/trading-journal.html
```

**Bookmark this URL** on all your devices (work laptop, personal laptop, phone)!

## 🔑 Create GitHub Personal Access Token

The GitHub token allows the dashboard to sync your trading data across all devices using a private GitHub Gist. Sync is manual to avoid API rate limits - use the "🔄 Sync Now" button to sync your data.

### Step 1: Generate Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Note:** `Trading Journal Sync`
   - **Expiration:** `No expiration` (or your preference - 90 days is recommended)
   - **Select scopes:** ✅ **gist** (ONLY this permission needed)
3. Scroll down and click **"Generate token"**

### Step 2: Copy Your Token

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately! You won't be able to see it again.

The token will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN WITH ANYONE!**

## ⚙️ Configure GitHub Sync

### On Your First Device (e.g., Work Laptop)

1. Open the dashboard: https://boydiego.github.io/trading/trading-journal.html
2. Click the **"⚙️ Setup GitHub Sync"** button (top right)
3. Paste your GitHub token in the input field
4. Click **"Save & Enable Sync"**

The dashboard will:
- ✅ Verify your token is valid
- ✅ Create a private GitHub Gist to store your data
- ✅ Upload your current trades to the Gist
- ✅ Enable manual sync (use "🔄 Sync Now" button to sync)

### On Your Other Devices (Personal Laptop, Phone)

1. Open the same dashboard URL: https://boydiego.github.io/trading/trading-journal.html
2. Click **"⚙️ Setup GitHub Sync"**
3. Paste the **same GitHub token** you created earlier
4. Click **"Save & Enable Sync"**

The dashboard will:
- ✅ Load your existing trades from GitHub Gist
- ✅ Enable manual sync (use "🔄 Sync Now" button to sync)

**All your devices are now synced!** 🎉

---

## 💡 Using the Dashboard

### Manual Sync

**IMPORTANT:** Sync is manual to avoid GitHub API rate limits. Your changes are always saved locally in your browser, but to sync across devices, you need to manually click the "🔄 Sync Now" button.

**When to sync:**
- ✅ After adding, editing, or deleting trades
- ✅ After importing new strategies
- ✅ When switching between devices

You'll see the sync status in the header:
- **⟳ Syncing...** - Currently uploading to GitHub
- **⟳ Synced ✓** - Successfully synced (shows for 3 seconds)
- **⟳ Synced** - Idle, ready to sync
- **⟳ Sync Failed** - Error occurred (check your internet connection or API rate limit)

### Manual Sync

Want to force a sync right now?
- Click the **"🔄 Sync Now"** button in the header

### Offline Support

The dashboard works offline using localStorage:
- ✅ Add/edit/delete trades without internet
- ✅ Data is saved locally in your browser
- ✅ When internet returns, data syncs automatically

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Data Storage

Your trading data is stored in **two places**:

1. **Browser localStorage** (local, per-device)
   - Fast access
   - Works offline
   - Persists across browser sessions

2. **GitHub Gist** (cloud, synced across devices)
   - Private Gist (only you can see it)
   - Manually synced via "🔄 Sync Now" button
   - Accessible from all your devices

### Sync Flow

**When you add a trade on Work Laptop:**
1. Trade is saved to localStorage (instant)
2. Click "🔄 Sync Now" to upload to GitHub Gist
3. On Personal Laptop or Phone, click "🔄 Sync Now" to download the latest data

**When you open the dashboard on Personal Laptop:**
1. Dashboard loads local data from localStorage (instant)
2. If GitHub sync is enabled, it loads latest data from Gist automatically on page load
3. To get the latest changes made on other devices, click "🔄 Sync Now"

### Conflict Resolution

If you edit the same trade on two devices at the same time:
- **Last write wins** - The most recent change is kept
- For best results, close trades on one device at a time

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid GitHub token" Error

**Cause:** Token is incorrect or doesn't have the `gist` permission

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Delete the old token
3. Create a new token with `gist` permission
4. Configure sync again with the new token

### "Sync Failed" Message

**Possible causes:**
1. **No internet connection** - Wait until you're online, sync will resume automatically
2. **Token expired** - Create a new token and reconfigure
3. **Gist was deleted** - The dashboard will create a new Gist automatically

**Solution:** Click **"🔄 Sync Now"** to retry manually

### Data Not Syncing Between Devices

**Check:**
1. ✅ All devices are using the **same GitHub token**
2. ✅ Sync status shows "Synced" (not "Sync Failed")
3. ✅ Internet connection is active
4. ✅ Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

### I Switched Browsers and Lost My Trades

**Cause:** localStorage is browser-specific

**Solution:**
1. Configure GitHub sync on the new browser
2. Your trades will load automatically from GitHub Gist

### Storage Quota Exceeded

**Cause:** Too many trades in localStorage

**Solution:**
1. Export old trades to CSV
2. Clear old trades from the dashboard
3. GitHub Gist will keep your historical data safe

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Is My Data Safe?

✅ **YES!** Your data is secure:
- GitHub Gist is **private** (only you can access it)
- Your token is stored in browser localStorage (never sent to third parties)
- All communication with GitHub uses **HTTPS**
- No external servers are used (everything is client-side)

### Who Can See My Data?

**Only YOU!**
- Your GitHub Gist is **secret** (not public)
- Your repository is **private**
- Your GitHub token is stored **locally** in your browser

### Can I Revoke Access?

Yes! To disable sync:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find "Trading Journal Sync" token
3. Click **Delete**

The dashboard will continue to work offline using localStorage.
